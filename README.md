# ChadMC

## About

Adds two commands to interact with a flask web server connected to the Google Gemini API.
Instancing is based on player names so every player gets their own personal Chad. In the future I plan on updating this to use the world for instancing so players can share a Chad on their server.

### Commands

/tellchad \<message>. Sends message to Chad and prints response to the chat\
/resetchad. Resets the chatbot effectively clearing its history

### Installing
Download the lastest version from the CurseForge website or the releases tab.
The master branch will be used for the latest version and branches of past versions will be made as I update the mod.

### Host your own Chad

### TODO
- [x] Send full json data to server for user and world differentiation
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [x] Async HTTP requests to prevent minecraft from lagging out when you try to talk to Chad
